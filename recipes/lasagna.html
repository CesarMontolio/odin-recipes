            <li>Onion:</li><body>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</body>
            <li>Canned tomatoes:</li><body>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</body>
            <li>Fresh herbs:</li><body>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</body>
            <li>Sugar:</li><body>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</body>
            <li>Spices and seasonings:</li><body>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</body>
            <li>Noodles:</li><body>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</body>
